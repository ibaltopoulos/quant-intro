    "* **Tuple:** They are immutable and are enclosed within parentheses ()\n",
    "* **Dictionary:** A hashtable of key value pairs. They are enclosed by curly braces {} and values can be accessed using square brackets []. The key can be any python type but it's usually a string or number. The value can be any arbitrary python object. Elements are unordered."
