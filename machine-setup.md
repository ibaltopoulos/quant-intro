### Getting your machine setup

#### Setting up Visual Studio
We use Visual Studio 2013 Professional. You can get a copy of the installation files from [here]() 

Also, you'll want to install some plugins.

* [Productivity Power Tools 2013](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dbcb8670-889e-4a54-a226-a48a15e4cace)

Themes
I've had a number of requests for my Visual Studio theme over the years, so I will provide it here.

1. First, download and install the theme fonts. One is called Dina, which is the font I use for the output console. The other is called Envy Code R and it is great. There are two variants. The VS version uses Italic as Bold.
2. Then download the theme itself, saving it somewhere convenient for importing into Visual Studio.
3. In VS: Tools -> Import and Export Settings...
4. Enjoy.

#### Setting up SQL Server

We use SQL Server 2014 Standard Edition (64-bit). You can get a copy of the installation files form over <a href="\\orbis.co.uk\London\Source\MSDN\SQL Server 2014 Standard">here</a> 

Make sure you install the "SQL Server Data Tools"
