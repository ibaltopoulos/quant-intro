Any stock that has acted better than average can be ignored.
You want to buy the stocks people hate. Look at what's out of favour.

Three things need to align:
- Market 
- Sector
- Stock itself


What is out of favour? Look at long term price chart, relative performance and 
absolute performance needs to be bad for over 2 years so that we can let the
economic cycle to play out.

High return on equity don't pay dividends

Look at companies with depressed prices and depressed pre-tax profit margins.

Sensitivity of share prices to changes in attitude by investors to the company. 
When something is sensitive to bad news but not sensitive to good news it might be 
time to sell.

If something is depressed for a long time then more bad news doesn't affect it 
at all but good news will affect it. 


Buy above average companies that are trading below the assessment of intrinsic value.

The essense is concentrating on great buying. The selling takes care of itself when
you have a very concentrated portfolio. Limit your portfolio to 10 securities.


Assessing intrinsic value
- Shares are substantially underpriced
- Peter Lynch book. 
- Focus on Earnings growth rate or Cash Flow growth rate, and predictability of those.
